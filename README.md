## Booting Krypton
To launch Krypton you will need to set `_G.License =` to true. This will accept the license agreement on your behalf. Krypton will only work when the license agreement is agreed by the user.
```lua
_G.License = false
_G.KryptonVersion = "a3.4"
BootableURL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RENBex6969/KryptonReload/main/Krypt0n.lua"
loadstring(game:HttpGet(BootableURL))()
```
## Krypton Rewind
* Hated the new update?
If then change KryptonVersion to any version u would like to use!

**Example**
```lua
_G.License = true
_G.KryptonVersion = "a2.5"
BootableURL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RENBex6969/KryptonReload/main/Krypt0n.lua"
